Simple Eye Tracker
==================

Super-simple C API to the [Tobii EyeX eye tracker](http://www.tobii.com/en/eye-experience/eyex/), suitable for binding in scripting languages.

Please see the releases page for a precompiled DLL. To compile the DLL yourself, copy the repository into the samples subdirectory of the EyeX SDK and build the Win32 release version. See Tracker.h for the list of available functions.

If you're interested in calling this API from Dragon NaturallySpeaking, check out my [blog post](http://handsfreecoding.org/?p=16).
